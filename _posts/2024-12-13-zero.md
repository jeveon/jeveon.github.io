## Introduction
Do People All Have the Same Brain Shape? Most people probably answer ‘no’. Then, do people with schizophrenia have abnormalities in the same part of their brains? This is not an easy question to answer. However, there is a simpler way to think about it, with another example. If a person breaks an arm, will the cross-sectional area of the fracture be the same for everyone? Probably not. Likewise, not only do schizophrenia patients have different brain structures compared to normal brains, but there are also differences in brain structures among schizophrenia patients. This may be because the long-term interaction of genetic risk and environmental factors has altered the pathways of brain structure development for everyone. These findings suggest the need for personalized diagnosis and treatment.

This need can be addressed in part through deep learning. Deep learning models can analyze vast amounts of data to identify important patterns that humans can overlook, enabling fast and accurate disease classification and prediction. As mentioned earlier, this can quickly detect unknown characteristics of schizophrenia and suggest customized treatment options to patients. However, these models require large amounts of labeled data, making it difficult to propose personalized treatments without sufficient prior information. Furthermore, modern social factors such as environmental pollution, increased stress levels, and long-term exposure to electronic devices are also contributing to the rise of new brain diseases. Therefore, there is a growing challenge in modern medicine for systems that can quickly and accurately diagnose previously unknown diseases.

To address this challenge, an AI technique called Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) has received great attention. ZSL is a technique for developing models that can recognize new objects or perform tasks without explicitly learning about specific categories. ZSL solves new problems by applying knowledge from different tasks to unfamiliar situations. ZSL allows us to analyze medical images to identify and predict patterns of new diseases that have not been explicitly learned. Therefore, in this article, we provide a detailed analysis of ZSL and examine its accuracy in brain image identification. We also want to find out if ZSL can be applied to actual brain disease diagnosis and what the direction of ZSL and brain image will be in the future.

## Zero-Shot Learning
Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is an innovative approach in deep and machine learning that is designed to allow models to recognize and classify new classes they have never seen during training. For example, in the animal image classification problem, a ZSL model can accurately classify images based on supplementary information, even if they have never seen a class called "Jaguar" in their training data. This demonstrates the model's ability to leverage prior knowledge and supplementary information to infer about new classes.

The core of ZSL is to leverage supplementary information to establish the relationship between the learned and unseen classes. This supplementary information bridges the gap between the learned and new classes and improves the model's predictive ability. ZSL utilizes supplementary information primarily in three ways. First, attribute-based mapping defines the main properties of the input data, by which it learns the relationships between classes. For example, in animal classification, properties such as "number of legs" can be used. Second, semantic relations learning learns potential semantic connections between classes, thereby enhancing the model's understanding of unseen classes. Third, feature generalization enables more accurate prediction for new classes by generalizing common features between classes based on limited training data. In this way, the ZSL model combines existing knowledge with supplementary information to have strong reasoning ability to predict unseen classes.

The learning mechanism of ZSL lies in mapping the input data to the semantic space, and using class attributes, hierarchical information, and other relationships to understand the new data. In this process, the input data is first transformed into a high-dimensional feature vector. Then, deep learning models (e.g., CNN, Transformer) are used to embed the data into the semantic space, and additional information is used to learn the inter-class relationships. The learned model generates a new class of embedding vectors based on additional information about the class that has not been seen. In the test phase, the input data is mapped to the semantic space, and the prediction is made for the new class by returning the most similar class vector.

As such, ZSL provides strong generalization capabilities for data that have not been able to take advantage of the knowledge learned from existing data, which plays an important role in solving new problems in various fields.

## Research about Brain Imaging with ZSL
ZSL has emerged as an innovative approach in brain imaging analysis, with significant advances in both brainwave-based image search and MRI reconstruction. ZSL is highly useful in fields such as brain-computer interface (BCI) and medical imaging, allowing models to make predictions about unseen data or classes without explicit training. Two major studies highlight the strong application potential of ZSL in these fields, demonstrating its potential to overcome traditional challenges and improve model performance.

### Study 1: EEG-Based Image Retrieval
The first study, titled "A Zero-Shot Deep Metric Learning Approach to Brain–Computer Interfaces for Image Retrieval" (Ben McCartney et al. Knowledge-Based Systems 2022) proposes a novel framework for EEG-based image retrieval using zero-shot learning. This research shows how ZSL can be used to map EEG data and image features into a shared feature space, allowing for the retrieval of images that were not part of the training set. Specifically, the framework maps EEG signals generated during image observation to visual features, effectively enabling the identification and retrieval of images that were never directly seen or used during training.

### Study 2: MRI Reconstruction with SLATER
The second study, titled "Unsupervised MRI Reconstruction via Zero-Shot Learned Adversarial Transformers" (Yilmaz Korkmaz et al. IEEE 2022) presents an unsupervised MRI reconstruction method using zero-shot learned adversarial transformers (SLATER). Traditional MRI reconstruction methods rely heavily on supervised neural networks, which require large, paired training datasets. SLATER minimizes the need for complex computational resources while still accurately capturing important spatial features in MRI data. This study demonstrates that SLATER can effectively improve generalization performance and inference efficiency, even when applied to new MRI data that it has not previously encountered.

## Conclusion
Zero-shot learning (ZSL) has shown significant potential in brain imaging, especially EEG-based image retrieval and MRI reconstruction. Both studies show how ZSL allows models to be generalized to unseen data, thus eliminating the need for large, paired datasets. These applications highlight the ability of ZSL to reduce its dependence on labeled data by providing adaptive, efficient, and scalable solutions in medical imaging and personalized diagnosis.

Therefore, in the future, the integration of ZSL with various imaging modalities and improved semantic embedding techniques will further improve the model adaptability. As computational resources improve, real-time ZSL applications will become more practical in brain-computer interfaces and clinical diagnostics, enabling more personalized diagnoses.
