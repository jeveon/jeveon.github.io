## Brain Decoding

Brain Decoding is a technology that analyzes neural activation patterns in the brain to decode a person's thoughts, visual experiences, or movement intentions. As shown in the image below, brain activity patterns are measured using various methods. The recorded data is then analyzed through a decoder to infer a person's thoughts, intentions.

Brain Decoding has numerous applications. For instance, it can be used in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) to control external devices by directly connecting the brain and computers. It is also used in mental health treatments, such as addressing trauma, and in reconstructing images or videos a person is viewing. Additionally, it may even allow us to record the content of dreams during sleep.

## Deep learning

Deep Learning is a branch of Machine Learning (ML) and it uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to learn from data. Unlike traditional Rule-Based systems, where explicit rules are defined by humans, ML approaches enable computers to learn patterns and rules directly from data.

Deep Learning is characterized by deeper and more complex structures. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are inspired by the human brain and consists of multiple layers. Each layer's nodes extract features from the input data and pass them to the next layer. Through this process, higher-level features are learned. Deep Learning surpasses simple linear operations, enabling the learning of nonlinear relationships, and it allows it to effectively handle complex data patterns that are challenging to define manually.

So why is Deep Learning necessary? While Deep Learning requires large amounts of data and significant computational resources for training, making it impractical for all scenarios, but it is essential to Brain Decoding.

The signals are that we receive from the brain. The signals are not as straightforward. Instead, they comprise diverse and complex values. Analyzing these signals one by one and defining rules for them would require an enormous amount of time. Thus, the ML approach, particularly Deep Learning, which automatically identifies features and rules, is crucial for making predictions and interpreting brain signals more effectively.

## CNN: Convolutional Neural Network

Now, let me explain the three most used Deep Learning models in Brain Decoding. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is architecture designed to process images or unstructured data. CNNs extract features from input data using filters to learn local patterns while incorporating nonlinear functions to capture complex data relationships. Pooling layers reduces the size of the feature maps, summarizing important information and improving computational efficiency. Finally, the features pass through fully connected layers for final classification or prediction. Therefore, CNNs is good at preserving spatial information while learning from data.

## RNN: Recurrent Neural Network

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are architecture designed to process and learn from sequential data, such as time-series data and text.
RNNs transmit information through input data and hidden states, learning the temporal relationships within data. By receiving information from previous time steps, they capture the context of sequential data. However, RNNs face challenges when learning long sequences, as the influence of early input data diminishes over time. To address this, variants like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) were developed, enabling more effective learning of long-term dependencies.

## DBNs: Deep Belief Networks

Finally, Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) are composed of multiple stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs).

An RBM consists of a visible layer (input layer) and a hidden layer and operates as a two-layer neural network. RBMs learn data in an unsupervised manner, modeling the distribution of the input data. The first RBM learns the original data, while subsequent RBMs use outputs of the previous RBM as their input, progressively extracting higher-level features. After pretraining, the entire network is fine-tuned through supervised learning. This enables DBNs to automatically find meaningful features from input data.


So, we learned about the kinds of DL models that we use for brain decoding. With these models, we can do brain decoding in different fields, but I'm going to talk about how to decode dreams. So, first, we need to know exactly what dream is.

## What is Dream?

Dreaming is a mental phenomenon that occurs mainly during sleep, which means a state in which various images and emotions are mixed.
When a person goes to sleep, it goes through the Non-REM stage and REM stage, and usually begins to dream in the REM stage.

https://www.simplypsychology.org/sleep-stages.html  

In the REM stage, the hippocampus regenerates recent memories and the neocortex reconstructs memories. Currently, neurotransmitters cause abnormal and creative connections, and various pieces of memory form a dream. Additionally, because the brain's frontal lobe is inactivated, the time sequence may be mixed up in dreams or situations that are impossible may appear. However, we can feel various emotions in dreams because the amygdala, which is related to emotions, works actively in dreams.


During the dream, the brain stores and reconstructs memory. Because of this a process, dreams have four characteristics.

First, it reflects the concerns and feelings of recent life. Reconfigure the previous day's events by mixing them with various memories reflecting the long-term and short-term feelings and concerns

Second, creativity, future prediction, and the connection of various memories lead to creative thinking. It also analyzes past patterns and warns of important problems in the future.

Third, it helps strengthen memory. New memories are stored in a more permanent form during sleep, and dreams could be a piece of memory of that process.

Finally, Dream is easy to forget: The content of the dream itself is excluded from the long-term memory process, and only the amygdala is activated, so if you don't feel the emotion in the dream, it is easily forgotten.

## Recent Research

Then, what if the researcher creates a technology to represent dreams as images? We will be able to see the concerns or feelings in our dreams again and get one step closer to the answer our minds want. It can also increase our fun and creativity with experiences that we cannot experience in real life.

So let me briefly introduce you to a paper that I recently researched about dreams. The name of the paper is this. ([Dream Emotions Identified Without Awakenings by Machine and Deep Learning in REM Sleep](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10405808)).

The research process is like this. Subjects wear EEG sensors while sleeping. When sensors detect REM sleep, they are awakened to report their dreams. The collected EEG data were mapped as shown in the pictures below. Using this collected data, we predict the emotions experienced during a dream using a hybrid model that combines CNN and ML. The accuracy of distinguishing whether a dream has emotions is about 66%, and the accuracy of predicting whether a dream is positive or negative is about 64%. You might think it is a simple study, but it is less accurate. So, making a completely reconstructed video of a dream remains a task for future research.

## Future Work

You may think that we have too long a way to go. but, I think the field of analyzing dreams will develop faster with the recent development of AI. So I we brought a video to inspire you about dream decoding.

In this video, I think it’s a good representation of a dream. It changes quicky around you and flies in the sky or sees people you’ve never seen before. However, it's not a real video of dream decoding, but it creatively describes what future dream decoding will look like.

## Conclusion

Exploring the unknown has always been an exciting journey. By studying dreams, we may find ourselves closer to unlocking the depths of our subconscious. And to reach this subconscious, deep learning methods will be essential. Someday, I hope we can start each morning by watching the dreams we had the night before. Thank you.
